-- remember updated_at for all the tables needs to be handles consistently by the backend logic, dont forget this

-- remember the raw sql schema and prisma schema must stay aligned, they must not drift into different directions.
  -- migrations that help keep them in sync

-- Once a user or resource is soft deleted, it cannot be restored. However, a new user may still be created with the same email after the previous user is soft deleted, and a resource owner may still create a new resource with the same name after all of their resources with that name have been soft deleted. These rules are enforced in the backend.

----
-- original step 5 rules wording
----
-- add logic in the backend that so that reservations are only valid if they fall inside the resource availability window
-- The backend can enforce that one owner cannot have more than one of the same resource name unless all the resources with that name belonging to that owner are soft deleted, only then can the owner make the resource again. But if the resource with that name belonging to that owner exists in the resource table and it is not soft deleted, then it is blocked.
-- Test both self-booking and non-self-booking reservation scenarios 
-- reservation-user vs resource-owner relationship testing 



-- prevent invalid overlapping seeding with a trigger(or exclusion constraint) (for seeding) and in the backend for clients
-- js: a.start < b.end && a.end > b.start (a starts before b ends AND a ends after b starts)
-- the main area for overlap logic is the backend not the database

-- for interviews it is better to have most of the overlap logic in the backend, this is better to showcase in interviews
-- so limit the database implementation of overlap logic to seeding

-- INVARIANTS/LIFECYCLE 
--------------------------------------

-- make it so that soft deleteing a resource deletes all the availability windows on that resource id and cancells all the reservations on that resource id
-- deactivating a resource should delete all availability windows on that resource id
-- can be done with a trigger

-- soft deleting a user should cancell the reservations that user has
-- soft deleting a user should soft delete all the resources that user owned and all availability windows on the users resources
-- these 2 can be done in one transaction (optional trigger for extra gaurd)

-- these sould be in service-level functions such as 
  -- softDeleteResource(resourceId)
  -- softDeleteUser(userId)
-- they should not be scattered randomly

-- make sure to enforce valid email in the backend (with joi validation) 
-- email: Joi.string().trim().lowercase().email().required()

-- resource exists but is inactive and should not accept new reservations

-- Availability windows for the same resource must not overlap or be adjacent.
-- Boundary-touching windows are not allowed.
--
-- Not allowed:
-- 09:00–10:00
-- 10:00–11:00
--
-- If the owner wants continuous availability, they should create one window:
-- 09:00–11:00
--
-- Allowed:
-- 09:00–10:00
-- 10:01–11:00
--
-- Best enforced at the DB level with and exclusion constraint(EXCLUDE USING gist).

-- Deleting an availability window should cancel active reservations for that
-- resource whose reserved time falls within that deleted window.
--
-- Since availability windows for a resource cannot overlap or be adjacent,
-- a reservation covered by the deleted window cannot remain valid through
-- another overlapping/touching window.
--
-- Best enforced in backend transaction logic.
--
-- But be consistent when updating windows too.
-- For example, if someone edits a window and makes it touch another one, it should be rejected.

-- for overlap detection(on availability windows) do it in both backend end and db(EXCLUDE USING gist) and explain it well in an interview
-- backend for clarity, database for integrity
-- overlap prevention is different for availability windows and reservations
-- for availability windwos you have to reject overlap and adjacent (for one resource)
-- for reservations adjacent reservations(for one resource) is fine overlap is not
-- so reservation 1: 9:00 to 10:00 and reservation 2: 10:00 to 11:00 for that resource is fine unlike availability windows

-- race conditions (e.g., double booking) 
-- SELECT ... FOR UPDATE 
-- transactional integrity for booking

-- test race condition by:
-- fire 5–10 concurrent booking requests (learn how to do this)
-- same resource, same time slot
-- only 1 succeeds
-- others fail cleanly

-- CLI to fire 10 concurrent booking requests (log it)
-- npx autocannon -c 10 -a 10 \
--   -m POST \
--   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--   -b '{"resourceId":1,"startTime":"2026-04-20T10:00:00Z","endTime":"2026-04-20T11:00:00Z","partySize":2}' \
--   http://localhost:3000/reservations

-- use a trigger to automate updated_at

-- I plan on adding soft delete for availability windows to block hard deletion of resources(and for historical record) since the soft deleted availability window would always be pointing to that resource even after soft deletion(along with on delete restrict). the only exception is if someone created an in active resource(that would start off with no availability window). I would also enforce that if someone creates an active resource, they must also created availability windows and if someone reactivated an inactive resource, they must include an availability window.
-- also make it so that if an owner inserts an inactive resource, they cannot insert availability windows for it until activation of the resource.

-- in the backend enforce that an availability window insert must be start_time >= now()
-- filter for usable windows by using: deleted_at IS NULL AND end_time > now() 
-- this filters out both expired and soft deleted windows
-- for normal availability

-- reservations should not update resource_id, they must make a new reservation 

-- do not allow updates for foreign keys.
  -- for example, if resource_id is decided in the reservation, you cannot change it, you must cancel the reservation and make a new one
  -- in the bakcned allow list do not list foreign keys
  -- final gaurd as a trigger in the db

-- When a resource is soft-deleted or made inactive, soft-delete that resource’s availability windows whose end_time > NOW(). Keep windows whose end_time <= NOW() for historical record.
-- so do not soft delete historical windows
